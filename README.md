### Howdy, I'm Wesley ðŸ‘‹

I'm a maker of things, living and working in beautiful California. My expertise spans the engineering spectrum with skills that cover the entire stack. By day I'm a JavaScript/TypeScript sorcerer at [SDG.la](https://www.sdg.la/) crafting pixel-perfect experiences for the top 1% of high-scaling Shopify Plus businesses.
